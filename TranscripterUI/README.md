The UI portion of the Transcripter program.

## Credits

- Font used is [Open Sans](https://github.com/googlefonts/opensans).
- In-application icons are BoxIcons, converted to a format for Avalonia in
  [Avalonia.IconPacks](https://github.com/ahopper/Avalonia.IconPacks) which I used for [`BoxIcons.axaml`](./BoxIcons.axaml).
- Upload screen based on (of all things) the YouTube video upload modal.
- Progress indicator design at the top is based on [this dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/15007566-Progress-Indicator-Dark) by Tyler Wain.
