# English Model

This is the expected location for the "English STT v1.0.0 (Huge Vocabulary)" model and scorer that was pre-trained by
Coqui, which can be found [here](https://coqui.ai/english/coqui/v1.0.0-huge-vocab), licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

Note that both files are not included in the repo due to size limitations. Rather, they are downloaded by the included
setup script in the parent directory.

Also note that technically any model can be used - however, the application expects certain ones, with the idea being
that they can be overriden through in-app settings.
